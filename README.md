## ⚡ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Template

1. **Fork the repository**:
   - Go to [https://github.com/LawrenceHua/modern-portfolio-template](https://github.com/LawrenceHua/modern-portfolio-template)
   - Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner
   - This creates your own copy under your GitHub account

2. **Clone your fork**:

   ```bash
   # Clone your forked repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/modern-portfolio-template.git
   cd modern-portfolio-template

   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up upstream** (optional, to get updates from the original template):
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/LawrenceHua/modern-portfolio-template.git
   ```

**💡 Pro Tip**: Forking gives you your own repository that you can customize freely. You can always get updates from the original template later if needed.

**🔄 Getting Updates** (if you set up upstream):

```bash
# Fetch updates from the original template
git fetch upstream

# Merge updates into your main branch
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Basic Configuration

1. **Update your information** in `src/config/site.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export const siteConfig = {
     name: "Your Full Name",
     title: "Your Job Title",
     description: "Your portfolio description",
     contact: {
       email: "your.email@example.com",
       phone: "+1 (555) 123-4567",
       location: "Your City, State",
       linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",
       github: "https://github.com/yourusername",
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Add your profile image**:
   - Place your photo in `public/images/placeholders/`
   - Update the path in `src/config/site.ts`

### Step 3: Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your portfolio!
